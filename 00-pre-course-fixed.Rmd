# Getting Started with Data in R {#getting-started}



Before we can start exploring data in R, there are some key concepts to understand first:

1. What are R and RStudio?
How do I code in R?
3. What are R packages?

We'll introduce these concepts in the upcoming Sections. 



## What are R and RStudio? {#r-rstudio}

Throughout this book, we will assume that you are using R via RStudio. First time users often confuse the two. At its simplest, R is like a car's engine while RStudio is like a car's dashboard as illustrated here.

More precisely, R is a programming language that runs computations, while RStudio is an *integrated development environment (IDE)* that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. So just as the way of having access to a speedometer, rearview mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio's interface makes using R much easier as well.
