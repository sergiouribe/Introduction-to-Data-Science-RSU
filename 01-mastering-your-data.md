Background
========================================================

Many students are scared by the data rather than curious and usually skip exploratory data analysis and go straight to advanced statistical models that they cannot explain later because they do not understand their data in depth. 

This course aims to provide basic knowledge, skills and tools to perform such an exploratory data analysis, with a major focus on publication-ready data visualization to detect patterns and trends in the data, to extract meaningful information from the data and to prepare for further inferential analysis.
