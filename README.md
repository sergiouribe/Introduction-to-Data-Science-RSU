# Introduction to Data Science
Facilitator: 		Sergio Uribe, PhD, MSc, DDS. sergio.uribe@rsu.lv
Language:		English
Target audience:	Doctoral and Master Students
Place: 	
## OBJECTIVE
The traditional approach to research programmes is to assume that students will find a way to analyse the data. This brings problems for the students, their teachers and a significant waste of time. Many students are scared by the data rather than curious and usually skip exploratory data analysis and go straight to advanced statistical models that they cannot explain later because they do not understand their data in depth. This course provides the basic tools for performing the initial stages of exploratory research data analysis, with a focus on data visualization to allow to enable them to extract information from the data. 
## LEARNING OUTCOMES
On successful completion of the course the students will be able to:
### Knowledge
Exploratory Data Analysis
Grammar of graphics
Data Management
Reproducibility 
### Skills
Mastering the RStudio interface
Install additional packages
Identify the formats of the tidy data structure
Identify an optimal strategy for collecting and exporting data: Forms, Spreadsheets, CSV 
Importing data into R
Perform an initial exploratory data analysis: head, dim, Na values, cross-tabulation
Identify basic data visualizations: points, histograms, bar, columns, boxplot
Generate summary tables
Use repositories to maintain, manage and share your data: GIT, OSF
Exporting the results of the exploratory analysis: Rmarkdown
Identify good practices in data organization, naming and coding
### Competence
On successful completion of the course, the students will be able to apply this knowledge and practical skills in the analysis of research data.

## COURSE APPROVAL
To successfully complete the course, each student must present a final project and code script with the exploratory analysis of data from an original dataset.
